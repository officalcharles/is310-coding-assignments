In this project I performed EDA onTop 500 Greatest Novels

The goal was to figure out what novels have sustained popularity through the years.
I used the columns 'oclc_holdings', 'gr_num_ratings'.
'oclc_holdings' serves as my historic basis since it shows the physical presence of novels in libraries.
By comparing this to modern technology like good reads ratings, I can try to look for patterns showcasing longivity.
