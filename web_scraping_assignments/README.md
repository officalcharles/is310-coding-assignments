I chose the Batman wiki fandom to web scrape.

The reason researchers would want to scrape the Batman Wiki is becuase they were contracted by HollyWood executives to find new stoylines for the franchise. In this script I am going to provide a 
storyline generator after scrapping the wiki for the excutives to use and hopefully stop making bad movies that make no money.

Looking through the robots.txt file, the website restricts specific bots from accessing the site, and allows general crawling for specific API and special creation pages.
It also disallows indexing and crawling of user, template, and help-related pages. Since I won't be interacting with those areas, I am fine to proceed.

[Robots.txt](web_scraping_assignments/batman.fandom.com_robots.txt.pdf)

Simply run it, and you'll have a new idea for a Batman movie!
