Europeana and Movie Data

I decided to use the movie data api for my project.
https://www.omdbapi.com/

You can get a omdb api key on their website. Once you sign up you will recieve it in your email.
Create a .env file with the europeana and omdv keys within the directory for the program to work.
To run my program, simply click the corresponding play button. 
You will then be prompted to enter a movie of your choice. 
There is an example of the "The Hobbit" that I tested on.
