The website Basketball Reference was built by Sports Reference, LLC, which was founded by Sean Forman. Forman originally launched Baseball Reference in 2000, and the success of that site led to the creation of Basketball Reference in 2004. Sports Reference operates multiple popular sports statistics websites, and their goal has been to provide comprehensive and accessible sports data.
